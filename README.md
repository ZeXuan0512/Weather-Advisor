## Prerequisites

Before running the Weather Advisor application, you'll need to get an API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and set up the environment file (`.env`).

## Steps to Set Up

### 1. **Sign Up for WeatherAPI**
   - Visit the [WeatherAPI website](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
   - Sign up for a new account.
   - After signing up, **verify your email**.

### 2. **Get Your API Key**
   - Once your email is verified, log in to your WeatherAPI account.
   - Go to the [API key page](https://www.weatherapi.com/my/).
   - Copy your **API key** from this page.

### 3. **Set Up the `.env` File**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
   - Add the following line to the `.env` file:
     ```
     OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
     Replace `your_api_key_here` with the API key you just copied.

### 4. **Upload the `.env` File**
